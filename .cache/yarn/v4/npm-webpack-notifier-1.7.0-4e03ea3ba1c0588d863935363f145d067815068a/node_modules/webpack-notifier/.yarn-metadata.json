It adds support for Windows and there is no need to manually install\nthe `terminal-notifier` package on OS X anymore.\n\nThe plugin will notify you about the first run (success/fail),\nall failed runs and the first successful run after recovering from\na build failure. In other words: it will stay silent if everything\nis fine with your build.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nUse `npm` to install this package:\n\n    npm install --save-dev webpack-notifier\n\nCheck the `node-notifier`\n[Requirements](https://github.com/mikaelbr/node-notifier#requirements)\nwhether you need to install any additional tools for your OS.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nIn the `webpack.config.js` file:\n\n```js\nvar WebpackNotifierPlugin = require('webpack-notifier');\n\nvar config = module.exports = {\n  // ...\n\n  plugins: [\n    new WebpackNotifierPlugin(),\n  ]\n},\n```\n\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Title\n\nTitle shown in the notification.\n\n```js\nnew WebpackNotifierPlugin({title: 'Webpack'});\n```\n\n### Content Image\n\nImage shown in the notification.\n\n```js\nvar path = require('path');\n\nnew WebpackNotifierPlugin({contentImage: path.join(__dirname, 'logo.png')});\n```\n\n### Exclude Warnings\n\nIf set to `true`, warnings will not cause a notification.\n\n```js\nnew WebpackNotifierPlugin({excludeWarnings: true});\n```\n\n### Always Notify\n\nTrigger a notification every time.  Call it \"noisy-mode\".\n\n```js\nnew WebpackNotifierPlugin({alwaysNotify: true});\n```\n\n### Skip Notification on the First Build\n\nDo not notify on the first build.  This allows you to receive notifications on subsequent incremental builds without being notified on the initial build.\n\n```js\nnew WebpackNotifierPlugin({skipFirstNotification: true});\n```\n",
