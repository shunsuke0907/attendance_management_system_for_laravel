If the function throws an error, the returned `Promise` will be rejected with that error.\n\nSupport for passing arguments on to the `fn` is provided in order to be able to avoid creating unnecessary closures. You probably don't need this optimization unless you're pushing a *lot* of functions.\n\n\n## Related\n\n- [p-finally](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-finally) - `Promise#finally()` ponyfill - Invoked when the promise is settled regardless of outcome\n- [More…](https://github.com/sindresorhus/promise-fun)\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com)\n",
