    "readme": "# fs-minipass\n\nFilesystem streams based on [minipass](http://npm.im/minipass).\n\n4 classes are exported:\n\n- ReadStream\n- ReadStreamSync\n- WriteStream\n- WriteStreamSync\n\nWhen using `ReadStreamSync`, all of the data is made available\nimmediately upon consuming the stream.  Nothing is buffered in memory\nwhen the stream is constructed.  If the stream is piped to a writer,\nthen it will synchronously `read()` and emit data into the writer as\nfast as the writer can consume it.  (That is, it will respect\nbackpressure.)  If you call `stream.read()` then it will read the\nentire file and return the contents.\n\nWhen using `WriteStreamSync`, every write is flushed to the file\nsynchronously.  If your writes all come in a single tick, then it'll\nwrite it all out in a single tick.  It's as synchronous as you are.\n\nThe async versions work much like their node builtin counterparts,\nwith the exception of introducing significantly less Stream machinery\noverhead.\n\n## USAGE\n\nIt's just streams, you pipe them or read() them or write() to them.\n\n```js\nconst fsm = require('fs-minipass')\nconst readStream = new fsm.ReadStream('file.txt')\nconst writeStream = new fsm.WriteStream('output.txt')\nwriteStream.write('some file header or whatever\\n')\nreadStream.pipe(writeStream)\n```\n\n## ReadStream(path, options)\n\nPath string is required, but somewhat irrelevant if an open file\ndescriptor is passed in as an option.\n\nOptions:\n\n- `fd` Pass in a numeric file descriptor, if the file is already open.\n- `readSize` The size of reads to do, defaults to 16MB\n- `size` The size of the file, if known.  Prevents zero-byte read()\n  call at the end.\n- `autoClose` Set to `false` to prevent the file descriptor from being\n  closed when the file is done being read.\n\n## WriteStream(path, options)\n\nPath string is required, but somewhat irrelevant if an open file\ndescriptor is passed in as an option.\n\nOptions:\n\n- `fd` Pass in a numeric file descriptor, if the file is already open.\n- `mode` The mode to create the file with. Defaults to `0o666`.\n- `start` The position in the file to start reading.  If not\n  specified, then the file will start writing at position zero, and be\n  truncated by default.\n- `autoClose` Set to `false` to prevent the file descriptor from being\n  closed when the stream is ended.\n- `flags` Flags to use when opening the file.  Irrelevant if `fd` is\n  passed in, since file won't be opened in that case.  Defaults to\n  `'a'` if a `pos` is specified, or `'w'` otherwise.\n",
