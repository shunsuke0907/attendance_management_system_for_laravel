If `instanceClone` is not specified, it will not attempt to clone non-plain objects, and will copy the object reference.\n\n## Attribution\n\nBased on [mout's](https://github.com/mout/mout) implementation of deepClone.\n\n## About\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Contributing</strong></summary>\n\nPull requests and stars are always welcome.
